## Welcome to the Retail Banking API

Our API allow easy and secure access to bank accounts, customer data, many payment methods, and much more. Many functions are publicly available.

Our APIs are RESTful. We use JSON format and OAuth authorization based on JWT.

This API is a sandbox version, and its purpose is to make developers familiar with the upcoming API production release. Moreover, it allows the developers to experiment and build applications which use the API before its official release. See sandbox for more information regarding the sandbox and what it is.

The purpose of this documentation is to give an overview of all the API: s which are included in API sandbox and the upcoming production API. There is separate documentation for each API which includes the full API reference of the particular API and any API specific information which is not presented in this overview.

This API implementation is Representational state transfer service (RESTful service in short), and the responses produced by the API are in JavaScript Object Notation, JSON format. The API also consumes JSON so requests sent to it should have the request body in JSON format.
